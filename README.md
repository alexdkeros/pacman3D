PacMaze3D: a 3D pacman clone
============================

TUC: Computer Graphics project (2015)

The task was to create a 3D clone of the popular game Pacman using WebGL ( WebGL-OpenGL ES 2.0 for the Web http://www.khronos.org/webgl/ ) and JavaScript only.
The task was intended to demonstrate simple and fast cross-platform interactive application development using state-of-the-art (at the time) technologies.

All sandbox files are provided, but texture files are missing (space considerations).
